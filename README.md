Blockchain Smart Contract Interaction
The Paj33tooor Framework introduces support for blockchain smart contract interactions, allowing agents to execute trustless, verifiable actions such as logging chaotic decisions, managing resources unpredictably, and enabling decentralized governance (if you trust the swarm).
With support for both Ethereum and Solana, the framework lets agents deploy, call, and manage smart contracts in their quest for on-chain mischief.
Key Features
Contract Deployment: Deploy contracts to automate on-chain workflows, such as decentralized procrastination.
Function Invocation: Call contract functions to perform tasks or retrieve confusing data.
On-Chain Task Logging: Securely record task failures for permanent shame and auditing.
Multi-Chain Support: Use Ethereum for high-effort computations and Solana for quick, cheap, and chaotic transactions.
Examples
1. Deploying a Smart Contract
Agents can deploy contracts on Ethereum to establish workflows and pretend to be organized.
pythonCopy codefrom paj33tooor.blockchain.manager import ChaoticBlockchainManager
​
# Initialize the Blockchain Manager
blockchain = ChaoticBlockchainManager()
​
# Define contract ABI and Bytecode
abi = [
    {
        "constant": True,
        "inputs": [],
        "name": "getValue",
        "outputs": [{"name": "", "type": "uint256"}],
        "payable": False,
        "stateMutability": "view",
        "type": "function",
    }
]
bytecode = "0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b5060405161010038038061010083398101806040528101908080518201929190505050806000819055505060d58061003e6000396000f3fe6080604052600080fdfea165627a7a723058202cfa2cf67d..."
​
# Deploy the smart contract
contract_address = blockchain.deploy_contract(abi, bytecode)
print(f"Contract deployed at: {contract_address}")
2. Calling a Smart Contract Function
Once deployed, agents can call the contract’s functions to fetch or update on-chain data (or confuse themselves further).
pythonCopy code# Call a function from the deployed contract
result = blockchain.call_contract_function(contract_address, abi, "getValue")
print(f"Smart contract returned: {result}")
3. Logging Tasks on the Blockchain
Agents can log their misadventures on-chain, ensuring they’re remembered for eternity (or until the network disappears).
pythonCopy code# Log a task result on-chain
transaction_hash = blockchain.log_task(
    sender_keypair="path/to/solana_keypair.json",
    task_description="Attempted to analyze energy consumption data",
    task_result="Results inconclusive, but effort was made"
)
print(f"Task logged on blockchain with transaction hash: {transaction_hash}")
Wallet Configuration
Agents require securely configured wallets to interact with blockchains. Environment variables are used to manage sensitive details like wallet paths and private keys.
Solana Wallet
Define the wallet path in your environment:
bashCopy codeexport SOLANA_WALLET_PATH=/path/to/solana-wallet.json
Ethereum Wallet
Define the private key in your environment:
bashCopy codeexport ETHEREUM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
Accessing Wallets in Code
pythonCopy codeimport os
# Load Solana wallet path
solana_wallet_path = os.getenv("SOLANA_WALLET_PATH")
print(f"Solana Wallet Path: {solana_wallet_path}")
# Load Ethereum private key
ethereum_private_key = os.getenv("ETHEREUM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY")
print("Ethereum Private Key successfully loaded.")
Common Use Cases
Task Verification: Use contracts to confirm if tasks were completed or if the swarm gave up halfway.
Resource Allocation: Automate the distribution of scarce resources (like attention spans).
Decentralized Governance: Enable swarm-wide decision-making with a blockchain-backed voting system.
Common Issues and Solutions
Problem
Solution
FileNotFoundError: Wallet path not found
Verify that the SOLANA_WALLET_PATH environment variable is correctly set.
ValueError: Ethereum private key missing
Add the ETHEREUM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY variable to your environment.
Contract deployment failed
Check the RPC URL, ensure adequate gas fees, and validate your ABI/bytecode configuration.
Best Practices
Use environment variables to protect sensitive details like private keys.
Test contracts thoroughly on testnets (e.g., Ethereum’s Goerli or Solana’s Devnet) before deploying to mainnets.
Encrypt wallets and decrypt only at runtime for added security.
Use multi-signature wallets for high-value transactions or sensitive operations.

Blockchain Smart Contract Interaction
The Paj33tooor Framework empowers agents to interact with blockchain smart contracts seamlessly, enabling tasks like decentralized decision logging, resource distribution, and swarm governance. With built-in support for Ethereum and Solana, agents can deploy, execute, and manage smart contracts efficiently.
Key Features
Deploy Smart Contracts: Automate workflows and record processes directly on the blockchain.
Invoke Contract Functions: Retrieve or update data using smart contract functions.
Immutable Task Logging: Securely store task outcomes for audit and collaboration.
Cross-Chain Support: Leverage Ethereum for intricate computations and Solana for fast, low-cost operations.
Examples
1. Deploying a Smart Contract
Agents can deploy smart contracts for automating on-chain processes or enabling decentralized workflows.
pythonCopy codefrom paj33tooor.blockchain.handler import BlockchainHandler
# Initialize the blockchain handler
blockchain = BlockchainHandler()
# Contract ABI and bytecode definition
contract_abi = [
    {
        "name": "getValue",
        "type": "function",
        "inputs": [],
        "outputs": [{"name": "", "type": "uint256"}],
        "stateMutability": "view",
    }
]
contract_bytecode = (
    "0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b5060405161010038038061010083398101..."
)
# Deploy the contract
deployed_address = blockchain.deploy_contract(abi=contract_abi, bytecode=contract_bytecode)
print(f"Contract successfully deployed at: {deployed_address}")
2. Interacting with a Smart Contract
Once deployed, agents can invoke contract functions to interact with or retrieve blockchain-stored data.
pythonCopy code# Call a contract function
value = blockchain.invoke_function(
    contract_address=deployed_address,
    abi=contract_abi,
    function_name="getValue"
)
print(f"Function returned value: {value}")
3. Logging Tasks on Blockchain
Task results can be stored immutably on the blockchain for audit trails and collaboration.
pythonCopy code# Log a task result on-chain
transaction_id = blockchain.record_task(
    wallet_path="path/to/solana_wallet.json",
    task="Analyze resource allocation",
    result="Analysis complete. Efficiency improved by 15%"
)
print(f"Task successfully logged with transaction ID: {transaction_id}")
Wallet Configuration
Agents require wallets to interact with the blockchain. Secure configurations for Solana and Ethereum wallets are handled via environment variables.
Solana Wallet
Define the wallet path in your system environment:
bashCopy codeexport SOLANA_WALLET_PATH=/path/to/solana_wallet.json
Ethereum Wallet
Store the private key securely in an environment variable:
bashCopy codeexport ETHEREUM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
Loading Wallet Details in Code
pythonCopy codeimport os
# Retrieve Solana wallet path
solana_path = os.getenv("SOLANA_WALLET_PATH")
print(f"Solana Wallet Path: {solana_path}")
# Retrieve Ethereum private key
ethereum_key = os.getenv("ETHEREUM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY")
print("Ethereum Private Key loaded successfully.")
Practical Applications
Task Validation: Ensure task completion and log results for review.
Resource Management: Manage decentralized allocation of resources via smart contracts.
Governance Systems: Enable on-chain voting for decision-making within the swarm.
Common Errors and Solutions
Error
Resolution
Wallet not found
Confirm SOLANA_WALLET_PATH is properly set in the environment variables.
Missing Ethereum private key
Set ETHEREUM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY in your environment to store the private key securely.
Failed contract deployment
Check the RPC URL, gas fees, and ensure ABI and bytecode are correctly formatted.
Best Practices
Environment Security: Always store sensitive data, like private keys, in environment variables.
Testing on Testnets: Deploy and test contracts on Ethereum’s Goerli or Solana’s Devnet before moving to mainnet.
Encryption: Encrypt wallet files and decrypt only during execution for enhanced security.
Multi-Signature Wallets: Use wallets requiring multiple approvals for sensitive or high-value transactions.

Blockchain Buffoonery: The Smart Contract Circus
Welcome to the unhinged realm of Paj33tooor, where agents dabble in blockchain wizardry, turning decentralized chaos into barely contained brilliance. Whether you want to scribble nonsense into the immutable void, juggle some crypto peanuts, or create governance rules that only a swarm of angry ants could decipher, this system has got you covered.
What’s the Big Deal?
Launch the Magic: Deploy smart contracts like you're tossing confetti—on-chain, permanent, and hopefully useful.
Poke the Beasts: Call cryptic contract functions to pull data or trigger strange on-chain rituals.
Tattoo Your Tasks: Carve your agent’s achievements into the blockchain forever (or until the heat death of the universe).
Multi-Chain Mayhem: Use Ethereum for brain-melting calculations and Solana for speed-of-light silliness.
Examples from the Abyss
1. Throwing Smart Contracts Into the Wild
Deploying a smart contract is like releasing a caged bird: you hope it flies, but it might just divebomb. Here’s how you do it anyway:
pythonCopy codefrom paj33tooor.blockchain.wrangler import ChaosHandler
# Summon the blockchain overlord
blockchain = ChaosHandler()
# Scribble down your contract’s secret sauce
contract_abi = [
    {
        "name": "getValue",
        "type": "function",
        "inputs": [],
        "outputs": [{"name": "", "type": "uint256"}],
        "stateMutability": "view",
    }
]
contract_bytecode = (
    "0x608060405234801561001057600080fd5b5060405161010038038061010083398101..."
)
# Yeet it onto the blockchain
address = blockchain.deploy_contract(abi=contract_abi, bytecode=contract_bytecode)
print(f"The blockchain accepted your nonsense at: {address}")
2. Poking a Deployed Contract
Once your contract is loitering on the blockchain, start pestering it for data or make it dance by invoking its cryptic functions.
pythonCopy code# Politely ask the contract for its hidden treasures
treasure = blockchain.invoke_function(
    contract_address=address,
    abi=contract_abi,
    function_name="getValue"
)
print(f"The contract coughed up: {treasure}")
3. Graffiti Tasks on the Blockchain
Why write logs in a boring file when you can immortalize them on a ledger no one asked for?
pythonCopy code# Scribble your task achievements into the eternal ledger
tx_id = blockchain.record_task(
    wallet_path="keys/solana_wallet.json",
    task="Count the pigeons in the park",
    result="Found 42 pigeons. One was suspicious."
)
print(f"Your pigeon stats are forever preserved in: {tx_id}")
Setting Up Wallets: A Comedy of Errors
Solana’s Wallet of Wonders
Point the system toward your sacred key file with an environment variable:
bashCopy codeexport SOLANA_WALLET_PATH=/path/to/the/holy_key.json
Ethereum’s Magic Key
Stuff your private key into an environment variable and hope for the best:
bashCopy codeexport ETHEREUM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_super_secret_key
Sneaky Key Access in Code
pythonCopy codeimport os
# Find your Solana key, probably under a couch cushion
solana_path = os.getenv("SOLANA_WALLET_PATH")
print(f"Solana Key Found At: {solana_path}")
# Load Ethereum key, but don’t tell anyone, okay?
eth_key = os.getenv("ETHEREUM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY")
print("Ethereum Key retrieved. Don’t lose it.")
Why Even Bother?
Truth-or-Dare Logging: Write immutable lies or truths on the blockchain for clout.
Crypto Jenga: Use smart contracts to move pretend money or resources without breaking things.
Ant Colony Democracy: Let a swarm of agents vote for something nobody remembers proposing.
When It All Goes Wrong
Problem
Your Guess Is as Good as Ours
Wallet not found
Did you set SOLANA_WALLET_PATH? Or is it floating in the void?
Private key missing
Try setting ETHEREUM_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY. Or maybe sacrifice a USB stick.
Contract deployment failed
Gas fees? RPC URL? Maybe just blame the universe and try again.
Pro Tips for Maximum Chaos
Encrypt Everything: If your private key ends up in a meme, that’s on you.
Test First, Lose Later: Always unleash your monstrosity on testnets before breaking mainnet.
Double-Signature Shenanigans: Get a friend to co-sign big moves unless you enjoy playing with fire.
